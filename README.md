# NPS Dashboard – Team Performance Tracker

### 📈 Overview
This project is a **sample version** of an Excel-based dashboard I built to track **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** and team performance metrics.  
It provides a simple, automated way for support teams to monitor individual and overall standings without needing constant sync meetings.
